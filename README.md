## About

Ecosail is an Autonomous Sailboat used for ocean environment monitoring. Water quality data such as Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Temperature, Turbidity, and Electrical Conductivity level will be collected by the sensors installed on the sailboat when navigate around the coastal area.

Data analysis on collected data to estimate water quality index (WQI) from limited number of data. Besides, spatial analysis is performed to estimate the surrounding water status according to the data collected along the navigation path. 

This application will dislay the real-time collected water quality data, predicted WQI value, interpolation map for monitored areas, and notifications generated upon detection of abnormal water status. 

User also can specify the coverage of the boat, perform sensor calibration, and monitor real-time sailboat location through this application.
